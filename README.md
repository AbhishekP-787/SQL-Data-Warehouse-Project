# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Data Warehouse Project** is designed to collect, store, and manage large volumes of structured data for analytical and business intelligence purposes. This project leverages ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to integrate data from multiple sources into a centralized repository, ensuring efficient querying and reporting.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust and scalable data warehouse that enables efficient data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence insights. It focuses on structured data storage, optimized querying, and seamless integration with analytics tools.

## 🏗️ Features
- **Data Integration:** Aggregates data from various sources (e.g., databases, APIs, flat files).
- **ETL Pipeline:** Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Data Modeling:** Implements Star and Snowflake schemas for optimized querying.
- **Scalability:** Supports large-scale data storage and retrieval.
- **Query Optimization:** Ensures fast analytical queries using indexing and partitioning.
- **Security:** Implements role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Database:** Amazon Redshift / Google BigQuery / Snowflake / PostgreSQL/SSMS
- **ETL Tools:** Apache Airflow / Talend / AWS Glue / dbt
- **Programming:** Python / SQL
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob Storage
- **Visualization:** Tableau / Power BI / Metabase

## 📊 Data Schema
- **Fact Tables:** Sales, Orders, Transactions
- **Dimension Tables:** Customers, Products, Time, Locations

## 📌 Data Engineering Specifications
- **Data Extraction:** Connects to various data sources such as relational databases, APIs, and external files.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleans, normalizes, and processes raw data into structured formats.
- **Data Loading:** Optimized batch and real-time ingestion into the warehouse.
- **Data Governance:** Implements data quality checks, logging, and monitoring.

## 📈 Data Analytics Specifications
- **Business Intelligence Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with BI tools for dashboards and reports.
- **Advanced Querying:** Supports complex SQL queries for trend analysis and insights.
- **Data Aggregation:** Enables efficient summarization of large datasets.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Supports ML/AI models for forecasting and decision-making.

## 🏆 Use Cases
- Business Intelligence and Reporting
- Real-time Analytics and Decision Making
- Data Integration from Multiple Systems
